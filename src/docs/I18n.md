# Internationalization (I18n)

This document outlines the internationalization (i18n) setup for the ERP System project.

## Approach

The project uses the `i18next` library to handle translations. This library was chosen for its flexibility, and robust feature set.

### File Structure

- `src/i18n/index.ts`: This file contains the `i18next` configuration, including the supported languages and the location of the translation files.
- `src/i18n/de.json`: Contains the German translations.
- `src/i18n/en.json`: Contains the English translations.
- `src/i18n/es.json`: Contains the Spanish translations.
- `src/i18n/pt.json`: Contains the Portuguese translations.

### Language Detection

The application uses `i18next-browser-languagedetector` to automatically detect the user's preferred language from their browser settings. The fallback language is Portuguese (`pt`).

## Adding New Languages

To add a new language, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new JSON file for the language in the `src/i18n` directory (e.g., `fr.json` for French).
2.  Copy the contents of an existing translation file (e.g., `en.json`) to the new file.
3.  Translate the values in the new JSON file to the new language.
4.  Import the new translation file in `src/i18n/index.ts` and add it to the `resources` object.
5.  Add the new language to the `languages` array in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to make it available in the language switcher.

## Adding New Translation Keys

When adding new text to the application that needs to be translated, follow these steps:

1.  Add the new key to all translation files (`de.json`, `en.json`, `es.json`, and `pt.json`).
2.  Provide the translation for the new key in each file.
3.  Use the `t` function from the `useTranslation` hook to display the translated text in the component.

Example:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();

  return <div>{t("myNewKey")}</div>;
};
```
